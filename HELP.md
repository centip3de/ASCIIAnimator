**Commands:**

(Do note that because of laziness, all commands MUST be typed EXACTLY as I typed them, i.e., there MUST be a space after the colons and each line MUST begin with an uppercase character.)

* Begin: <FrameName> - Begin a new frame setting the frame's name as the given FrameName.

* End: <FrameName> - The end of FrameName's frame.

* Time: <TimeNumber> - The length of time (in seconds, though going to nanoseconds is possible using decimal points) to display the given frame.

* Refresh: <BooleanValue> - Whether to refresh (clear the screen) before the given frame is displayed or not.

* Goto: <FrameName> - Goto the specified frame after this frame has been shown.

**Basic Animation Walkthrough**

For a basic animation, look in the /examples folder and reference back to these commands. Feel free to experiment a bit with it.
